# June 2024

- âœ… Implement simple `agent.actionschema.com/asst_xxxx/message` with `openai` SDK
- âœ… Expose `agent.actionschema.com/asst_xxxx/agent.json` with instructions & tools taken from openai's API.
- ðŸ¤” Revelation: `Asssistant` doesn't contain any information about the API URL, paths, or Authentication. This makes this whole idea problematic as tools cannot be accessed without external implementation. Therefore, instead, we could build `agent.actionschema.com/[agentSlug]/message` and `agent.json` and `openapi.json` but not with login to openai.

## Refactor Agents

âœ… Instead of `refreshOpenai`, let's create agents via a form in which you provide an `openapiUrl` and then you can manage further configuration. Ensure default instructions and other settings are generated by default.

âœ… Instead, store this for OpenAIAgent: `{ agentSlug, openaiSecretKey, deepgramToken, authToken, name, instructions, model, top_p, temperature, openapiAuth, openapiUrl, functionsCalculated }`

âœ… Rename `details.json` to `GET details` and ensure it provides all details including `openapiAuth` only if `Authorization` header is set to match authToken.

âœ… Refactor `/message` to not use an assistant

âœ… To support functions, it needs to call the OpenAPI based on something returned as step. https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/function-calling/quickstart

Confirm an agent with people-openapi tool works.

Ensure `message` can also handle files by url

Ensure `message` response can also handle more than just text

`/message` support for threads

Support for streaming via `/streamMessage`
