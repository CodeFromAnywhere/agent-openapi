admin.html: On this page the admin can see all their agents.

  First use window.prompt to get admin token prefilled from localStorage, that is saved to localStorage after. Then browse created agents using `/listAgents` endpoint.

  - Every agent links to user.html?agentSlug={slug}.
  - Every agent has a delete icon that will prompt 'are you sure' and deletes the agent using /removeAgent.

user.html:
  Get info from url - `?agentSlug=$&token=$&threadId=$` to oauth with token (X_AGENT_AUTH_TOKEN) and Authorization bearer token (given by user) and list all your threads (call `readAgentUser`).

  When clicking one, it should call `readAgentUserThread` for the threadId clicked. This results in the messages which then should be rendered at the screen.

  At the top there should be a form to create a new message and send it using `/message`. When sending this, immediately attach the sent message to messages, and wait for the fetch to respond and attach the resulting messages to messages as well. No need to reload `readAgentUserThread`.

jsonschema.html:
  make a form in html in which you can build up a JSON Schema of type object. use tailwindcdn to make it pretty.

  if you select object for a property, it should embed the form again, recursively to select properties for that object.

  show the Generated JSON in realtime.

  use tailwind to show the form and the generated JSON side by side
